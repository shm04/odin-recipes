        <ul>
            <li>Cooked rice</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Salmon</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 1 1/3 cups water to a boil. Add rice, and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar ,and salt. Blend the mixture into the rice.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). On a medium baking sheet, heat nori in the preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until warm.</li>
            <li>Center one sheet nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the avocado, and salmon in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll.</li>
            <li>Cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices using a wet, sharp knife.</li>
